# Temporal Mirror Frontend

This is a lightweight React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS starter powered by Vite.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

- The dev server defaults to http://localhost:5173
- `npm run build` compiles TypeScript and produces a production bundle in `dist/`
- `npm run preview` serves the built assets locally to validate production output

## Tailwind CSS

Tailwind is preconfigured via `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js`. Styles are sourced from `src/index.css`, which already applies the three Tailwind layers and basic global tokens.
